**Project Title**
Prewave alert term extractor

**Description**
Query prewave apis and extract specific term information from text. This application can be run against the real APIs or against test data. 

**Configuration**
This application can be run against the real APIs or against test data contained in the _test_data_ folder. To run against available 
APIs change  _prewave.mode_ from _test_ to _production_ in the application.yaml in the config folder

**Assumptions**
1. I have understood keepOrder=false to mean that each part of a word can appear in any part of the alert term. I did not understand this to mean that the term text should be split and reordered if every order possible and those combinations should be matched. For example, term _"he likes cake"_ should be searched for by its parts and not by each possible commbination of the words, such as
     term: he likes cake
     term: he cake likes
     term: likes he cake
     term: likes cake he, etc
2. I have not included any logic to handle term or alert language properties. I did not feel this was important in the context of searching for a term in a body of text.      
3. I have assumed that Cat = cat and there should not be special consideration for case 

**Getting Started**
*Go enviornment*
1. Install the go framework https://go.dev/doc/install  
2. Navigate to root of repository and run: _go run run main.go at_extractor.go at_processor.go_  

*Docker*
1. Build the docker image and host application  
   &emsp; a. Navigate to root of repository and build image: _docker build --tag prewave .  _  
   &emsp; b. Start the prewave container and expose port 8080 to port 8080 on the host: _docker run --publish 8080:8080 prewave_  

**Output**
1. A results file(prewave_results.json) will be genenated in the root of the repo
2. A http server started on [::]:8080 will serve a /results endpoint which can be invoved via  curl http://localhost:8080/results

**Approach**
1. Retrieve the prewave query terms from the HTTP API
2. Process the retrieved query terms   
   &emsp; a. Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive processing[Dog = dog]
   &emsp; b. Ensure only unique terms are made available for processing    
   &emsp; c. if KeepOrder is not requried   
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; i. Split the query term's text into individual words by space  
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ii. convert to lowercase for case-insensitive processing  
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; iii. Ensure only unique terms that have been split are made available for processing  	  
3. Retrieve the prewave test alerts from the HTTP API  
4. Perform analyis of retrieve alerts to determines in which alert a query term occurs  
   &emsp; a. Process each content within an alert  
   &emsp; b. Converts the contentâ€™s text to lowercase to perform case-insensitive comparisons  
   &emsp; c. For each term, check if the term exists as a whole word in the content    
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; i. regex.QuoteMeta which is a function that escapes all special characters in a string so that the string can be used as a literal  
   &emsp; d. Count the number of occurances that the term matches 
6. Provide a readable summary of the analyis conducted  
   &emsp; a. via output file at root of repo: prewave_results.json  
   &emsp; b. via http by invoking curl localhost:8080/results
